In function initfourCycleBasedCounter in Escape/FiveFromCycleClique.h, there was an array being allowed
of size gout->nEdges, instead of gout->nVertices (lines 41, 42). This is a problem in graphs where nEdges < nVertices, leading
to memory issues. This was pointed out by user Beatrice through a bug report.

Fixed common.mk to link using libc++ instead of libstdc++. The makefile will now work with clang.

Updated README to emphasize that the input Escape format should have an undirected edge given exactly once.
