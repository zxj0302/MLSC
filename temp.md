| Set1, 3, 5 | Defferent density | The three datasets are arranged in increasing order of density, as density can provide insights into the graph topology. We investigate the performance under various density settings. Dense graphs often exhibit patterns such as cliques, whereas widely used datasets like MUTAG tend to be sparse. Our analysis of the ground truth distribution on our website reveals that 23 out of 29 patterns do not appear even once in the entire MUTAG dataset. This limitation prevents a comprehensive comparison. Therefore, it is essential to utilize dense datasets for subgraph count testing. Furthermore, the distribution of ground truth indicates that as density increases, the range of local subgraph counts expands, presenting a more challenging scenario |
| Set2, 4, 6 | No max_degÂ limit | Unlike Sets 1, 3, and 5, these datasets do not impose a maximum degree limitation. Consequently, there is a higher likelihood for the graphs to contain a central node with a very high degree, a common characteristic in social media networks. Successfully performing on such graphs indicates that a model is resilient to very high-degree nodes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Set7-10    | Increasing Size   | To assess scalability, we employ four datasets of varying scales. A near-linear trend in runtime suggests that the model may have the capability to handle very large graphs, such as in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Conversely, if a model's runtime and memory usage sharply escalate with increasing graph size, it may not be a suitable option for subgraph counting in large graphs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
